# Overview

This guide is designed to help you get up and running with TypeScript in an Ember app.

<aside>

**This is *not* an introduction to TypeScript *or* Ember. Throughout this guide, we’ll link back to [The TypeScript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) and [the Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/) when there are specific concepts that we will not explain here but which are important for understanding what we’re covering!**

To get started, check out the instructions in [Getting Started: Installation](./getting-started/installation)

- If you're totally new to using TypeScript with Ember, start with [TypeScript and Ember](./ts/overview).
- Once you have a good handle on the basics, you can dive into the guides to working with the APIs specific to [Ember](./ember/overview) and [Ember Data](./ember-data/overview).
- If you're working with legacy (pre-Octane) Ember and TypeScript together, you should read [the Legacy Guide](./legacy/overview).
